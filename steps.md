# PROJECT_STEPS.md

This document outlines the sequential steps required to create and launch the Ludo King React App (Single-Player vs AI) using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup

1. **Initialize Project**
   - Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite.
   - Configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Establish the basic file structure:
     - **public/**: `index.html` and assets.
     - **src/**: Components, pages, game logic, utilities, and styles.

2. **Version Control**
   - Initialize a Git repository.
   - Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and build files.
   - Make the initial commit.

---

## Phase 2: Basic UI and Navigation

1. **Home Page**
   - Create `HomePage.js` with:
     - A Hero Banner introducing the game.
     - A "Start Game" button to initiate gameplay.
     - (Optional) Navigation links (e.g., to Instructions).

2. **Routing**
   - Set up React Router for navigation between:
     - Home Page
     - Game Screen (Game Board)
     - Instructions/Help Page (if applicable)
   - Implement navigation links in a Header or Navbar component.

3. **Instructions/Help Page (Optional)**
   - Create `InstructionsPage.js` that outlines game rules and instructions.

## Phase 3: Core Game Components and Logic

1. **Game Board Setup**
   - Develop the `GameBoard.js` component to render the Ludo board.
   - Lay out safe zones, token tracks, and board segments.

2. **Dice and Token Components**
   - Create a `Dice.js` component with dice roll animations and outcome display.
   - Develop a `Token.js` component for visual representation of player tokens.

3. **Game Controller**
   - Build the `GameController.js` component to:
     - Manage overall game state (using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`).
     - Handle turn switching and validate moves.
     - Integrate dice roll logic and token movement.

4. **Local Game State Management**
   - Use Reactâ€™s built-in state management to track game progress.
   - Ensure smooth updates to the UI based on state changes.

---

## Phase 4: AI Integration

1. **Develop AI Controller**
   - Create the `AIController.js` component to encapsulate AI logic.
   - Implement decision-making logic using JavaScript to simulate opponent moves.
   - Start with basic move algorithms, then refine for balanced gameplay.

2. **Integrate AI into the Game Loop**
   - Connect `AIController` with `GameController` to trigger AI moves on its turn.
   - Validate and update the game state based on AI decisions.
   - Test and adjust AI timing and decision logic for fairness.

---

## Phase 5: UI Enhancements and Testing

1. **Enhance UI/UX**
   - Refine animations and transitions using Tailwind CSS.
   - Add status displays and turn indicators (e.g., "Your Turn" or "AI is thinking...").
   - Improve responsiveness for a mobile-first design.

2. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Write unit tests using Jest for core game logic and component behavior.
   - Conduct integration tests to verify the complete game flow.
   - Perform playtesting to identify and resolve any bugs or gameplay issues.

3. **Documentation**
   - Update inline code comments and maintain developer documentation.
   - Create a user manual or in-app help section to guide new players.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment and Final Playable Stage

1. **Final Build**
   - Run the production build of the React app.
   - Test the production build locally to verify all features work as expected.

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).
   - Verify that the deployed version maintains full functionality and responsiveness.

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Test the app on various devices and screen sizes.
   - Gather initial user feedback and monitor performance.
   - Plan for iterative improvements and future enhancements.
