# Sound Files for Ludo King

This directory contains sound files used in the Ludo King game. Currently, there are placeholder empty files that prevent errors during development.

## Adding Real Sound Files

To add real sound files to the game, replace these placeholder files with actual MP3 files:

1. `dice-roll.mp3` - Sound played when the dice is rolled
2. `token-move.mp3` - Sound played when a token is moved
3. `token-capture.mp3` - Sound played when a token captures another token
4. `token-home.mp3` - Sound played when a token reaches home
5. `game-win.mp3` - Sound played when the player wins the game
6. `game-lose.mp3` - Sound played when the player loses the game
7. `button-click.mp3` - Sound played when a button is clicked

## Sound File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Size: Keep files small (ideally under 100KB each) for better performance
- Duration: Short sounds (0.5-2 seconds) work best for game feedback
